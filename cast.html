                Park in the 2019 Academy Award-winning black comedy film
                Parasite. She is also known for her leading roles in the films
                The Servant (2010) and The Concubine (2012), as well as for

              <p class="readmore">
                Cho Yeo-jeong was born in Seoul, South Korea. She debuted as a
                CeCi Magazine cover girl at the age of 16 in 1997, and began
                actively acting in 1999. Despite appearing in drama series,

                obscure. During this period, she was also unhappy with the
                limited roles being offered to her.
